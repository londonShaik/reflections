How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it gave me the line numbers

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can add/delete a functionality on any version; access any version at any point of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    i think it allows to create specific restore points, ie., only when the user wants to do so.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    they like to look at a whole project as an entity (in git, a repository). and change in a project may include multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log displays the log of all the changes that have been done so far and the commits made. diff shows the difference between two particular commits or versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it gives us the freedom to experiment and play with the components in the project. it gives us the confidence that we can rollback to a previous version easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i can use git for my university projects, and all the major company projects i am gonna take up in my career.
