When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 	when you either want many ppl to collaborate on your work. Or when you want to login from different workstations (from diff places possibly) and work on your project without having to carry your system (more like an online database in this case).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	you might or might not want to get the updated result of what everybody has done to your project. you might want to have your own version of it, and might want to pull requests when the time comes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branch - to add another feature, work on developement etc.; clone - github to local system copy; fork - github to github copy, when you want to add suggestions to someone else's repo also crediting him of the work done so far by him.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	you can locally add your changes to the repo without affecting the remote. then, once it is done, you can see how ahead you are from the remote. Also, after finalizing whether you add the feature to the repo or not, you can push your changes.
